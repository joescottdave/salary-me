                    <p>Creeping consumer inflation is about to get a lot less subtle when the world’s most valuable company and consumer brand releases its flagship iPhone X in December.</p>
                    <p>Price sensitive readers may want to shield their eyes.  The first £1000 iPhone will be released later this year and Apple has used this headline grabbing figure as cover for an increase of average prices across the range.</p>
                    <p>In 2009 when Apple released the iPhone 3GS it sold only four configurations of its flagship product, that has increased to more than 60 different iPhone configurations available from Apple depending on model, storage and colour.</p>
                    <p>This level of variety is unprecedented for a company that is closely associated with simplicity and minimalism.  </p>
                    <p>The iPhone 8 is more of a kind with its predecessors, using a design that was first sold as the iPhone 6 in 2014 and were it not for the envelope-pushing iPhone X due later this year it would not be out of place as the company’s flagship product.  With its premium glass construction and blazing fast silicon.</p>
                    <p>Despite impressive iterative improvements under the hood and modest refresh to the exterior the phone’s newest features will already be familiar to anyone using competitor products.  Wireless charging was first seen in an Android device 5 years ago.</p>
                    <p>The inclusion of wireless charging will mean saying goodbye to unibody metal construction.  Aluminium interferes with the way wireless charging works and after committing to the technology with its ‘Watch’ and phones, it is unlikely to be omitted in future devices.</p>
                    <p>The iPhone 8’s £699 price tag makes it the most expensive iPhone ever released at least for the next six weeks.</p>
                    <p>If you think that has been the case every year then you’d be wrong, the iPhone 6 came in £10 cheaper than its predecessor the iPhone 5S.  Enough for that first month’s worth of data.</p>
                    <p>This £100 increase on the iPhone 7’s release price last year marks the highest increase in price for a flagship model since the iPhone 3GS in 2009.</p>
                    <p>Brexit and the ensuing depreciation of the pound may go some way to explaining the difference. If we strip out VAT of approximately £117 we can make a better comparison with the US sticker price of $699, with Brits $70 out of pocket after currency conversion.</p>
                    <p>Apple is highly dependent on the iPhone for the lion’s share of its profits, and despite breaking sales records with each iteration the growth which investors demand has been slowing.  To counteract this Apple has managed to push up the Average Selling Price of each iPhone, thereby extracting more revenue from each sale.</p>
                    <p>It has done this more recently by concurrently releasing two flagship models, with the larger more expensive variant always outdoing expectations.</p>
                    <p>This year Apple will be releasing three iPhone models and the Plus rings in only slightly cheaper than the ten-year anniversary edition with its edge-to-edge OLED screen and face-scanning camera tech.</p>
                    <p>Reports of suppressed demand for the iPhone 8 came in heavily and countless reviews have questioned the market for the new device.</p>
                    <p>With two previous generations of the iPhone still supported and on sale, as well as the smaller SE, Apple customers for the first time are spoiled for choice, and anyone looking to replace an aging device may opt to show restraint and buy one of the more affordable older models, while fans of bleeding-edge tech will be forced to shell out for iPhone X or look elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>The increased screen-to-device ratio and accompanying price tag are not unique to Apple however with prices rising in anticipation for the thousand-dollar device that has been heavily trailed since before the release of the iPhone 7.</p>
                    <p>Will any of this have any effect on the buying habits of consumers? Will customers accustomed to having the latest and greatest status symbol from Apple reconcile themselves to this new price structure, or will Apple have succeeded in creating an exclusive product tier for only their least price-conscious customers?</p>
                    <p>It will be some time next year before we know if the iPhone X has a hope of achieving ubiquity.  Supply is reportedly constrained by the availability of OLED panels and the difficult of constructing the specialist camera array at speed.  Waiting lists abound when pre-orders open in late October.</p>
                    <p>A majority of smartphone consumers in the UK purchase their devices as part of an overall payment plan with their network provider and so the overall cost of the device is only observed through the lens of 24 monthly instalments (that include network service and allowances).</p>
                    <p>When the first iPhone was launched in 2007 and exclusively available on O2 the device was sold separately for £269 with a minimum contract price of £35 a month.  Ten years later and the same network is offering the iPhone X with an upfront cost of £29.99 and monthly cost of £77, pushing the cost of the device over two years to £1878.</p>
                    <p>Spending and consumer watch dogs advise that consumers seek more affordable ways of financing a purchase if they plan on paying in instalments.  Similar SIM plans can be bought for a fraction of the cost involved, particularly as most customers pay for much more data than they need. </p>
                    <p>Paying for your device through network providers means signing up to an invisible and eye-watering equivalent APR.</p>
