                    <p>More than a quarter of income tax payers made less than the Living Wage in the year 2014-15.  Eight million people or pay income tax earned less than £13,700.</p>
                    <p>Overall the bottom 50% of income tax payers – that’s more than 15 million workers - earned salaries of less than £19,000.</p>
                    <p>At the same time the CEOs of the UK’s largest energy firm were taking home an average salary more than a hundred times larger.</p>
                    <p>The combined income of just six men was as high as £12 million, or £2million each.  Figures that might make even their fellow one percenters feel poor.</p>
                    <p>The top 1% of earners were each making more than £162,000.  The average income tax payment made by this group is almost as high at £141,000, suggesting average pay of more than £350,000.</p>
                    <p>In this year alone, 300,000 people made over a hundred billion, roughly 12% of all recorded income.</p>
                    <p>Energy companies were again the target of the Prime Minister’s ire this week, singled out in a speech beset with problems at her party’s Manchester conference.</p>
                    <p>When then Chancellor George Osborne took the ‘Living Wage’ moniker for his own increase to the minimum wage in 2015, he set a target for the minimum wage to reach 60% of the median wage by 2020, and is therefore projected to climb to £9 an hour.</p>
                    <p>Cleverly soundbite-friendly target is aided by flat-lining pay across the board.  While incomes continue to grow at the top and the bottom, those in the middle are seeing historic stagnation not seen since the Napoleonic Wars.</p>
                    <p>The Living Wage commission was set up in 2016 to oversee the calculation of Living Wage rates in London and the rest of the UK.</p>
                    <p>In the latest year for which incomes data from the treasure is available, the Living Wage was set at £7.85 an hour, 35p higher than Osborne’s version.  This would have meant an annual income of £16,328 and at the time almost 30% of income taxpayers did not meet this level.</p>
                    <p>This can be explained by the prevalence of part-time work in the economy which has been blamed by the IMF for some of the lacklustre pay-growth.</p>
                    <p>Disposable household income paints an altogether rosier picture than the individual income stats.  Average disposable income by household is 50% higher  than that of an individual based on our projections of take home pay from the current average weekly wage £505.</p>
                    <p>Three years of relatively low inflation seem to have ended with the latest figures skirting 3%.  The Bank of England has an inflation rate target of 2%.</p>
                    <p>Overall pay growth has had an unequal distribution with most of the increase going to the lowest paid.  This masks a growing discontent for those on middle incomes who have seen below inflation pay rises for many years now.</p>
                    <p>Nowhere has this struggle played out more publicly than in government negotiations with NHS flag-carries; nurses and junior doctors.</p>
                    <p>Theresa May was at pains to answer questions from a nurse in the audience during a BBC Question Time General Election Special, demanding an end to the 1% cap imposed on pay rises in the public sector.  This is issue has become totemic of problems facing workers in all parts of the economy.</p>
                    <p>Newly qualified doctors and nurses see not a great difference in their starting pay of around £23,000, with the former’s rising much more rapidly to £30,000 and beyond with further specialisation.</p>
                    <p>The Government has shown a willingness to budge recently with proposed pay rises for Police and Prison Officers of more than 2%.  These increases are set to come with no commensurate increase in funding and will see funding cut from other areas of regional police forces’ budgets.</p>
                    <p>Small businesses are often similarly pained by any jumps in the minimum wage, and cited in many objections.  Some employers report making creative adjustments in order to cope with the extra cost, either laying off staff or reducing hours to ensure that their wage bill remains flat.</p>
                    <p>The Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government indicated an aim to lift all minimum wage workers out of tax through a steady increase in the personal allowance.</p>
                    <p>There has been some progress since 2010 when 25% of all income taxpayers earned less than a full-time minimum wage.</p>
                    <p>The figures show that 17% of income taxpayers – roughly 5.2 million workers – were below the equivalent threshold of £13,520 for that year.</p>
